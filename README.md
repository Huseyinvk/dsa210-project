NutritionImpact - The Effect of Healthy and Unhealthy Eating Habits on Well-Being
Motivation
Healthy nutrition is one of the key pillars of long-term physical and mental well-being. However, modern lifestyles often lead to irregular eating patterns, processed food consumption, and nutrient imbalance.
This project aims to analyze how healthy and unhealthy eating habits affect overall health indicators such as energy levels, BMI, stress, and productivity.
By studying real data, we hope to understand the measurable impact of diet quality and identify strategies for sustainable eating.
