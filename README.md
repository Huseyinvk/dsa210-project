## The Impact of Eating Habits on Sleep Quality

### Motivation

Two of the most critical determinants of human well-being are nutrition and sleep. These two factors are closely interconnected: while poor nutrition can lead to disturbed sleep, insufficient sleep can also cause unhealthy eating behaviors. Unbalanced or unhealthy eating habits such as high sugar intake, excessive saturated fat consumption, or low fiber intake may negatively affect sleep duration, sleep latency, and sleep efficiency.

Healthy eating habits in this project are defined based on nutritional balance and food quality. Specifically, a healthy diet includes:
Appropriate caloric intake based on individual needs,
Adequate consumption of macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) in balanced proportions,
High intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains,
Limited consumption of processed foods, refined sugar, and caffeine,
Sufficient hydration and consistent meal timing throughout the day.
This project aims to analyze how these healthy eating factors influence different aspects of sleep quality using real or simulated data. The ultimate goal is to provide evidence-based insights that encourage healthier eating and better sleep outcomes.

### Objectives

Examine the relationship between overall dietary quality and sleep indicators such as total sleep duration, sleep latency, and sleep efficiency.
Identify which nutritional components (e.g., sugar, fat, protein, calorie intake) most strongly influence sleep quality.
Investigate the effects of meal timing (e.g., eating late at night) on sleep onset and depth.
Explore how caffeine and hydration levels interact with diet quality to influence sleep outcomes.

### Data Sources

Daily diet logs: containing total calorie intake, macronutrient distribution (protein, carbohydrates, fat), sugar, fiber, and saturated fat levels.
Sleep tracking data: total sleep duration, deep sleep percentage, sleep onset latency, and sleep efficiency from wearable devices or apps.
Self-reported data: mood, perceived sleep quality, and stress levels collected via surveys.
Additional variables: caffeine intake (cups per day), water consumption (liters per day), and physical activity level (minutes of daily exercise).

### Methodology

The project will follow a structured, data-driven analysis process:
#### Data Collection and Cleaning: 
- Gather nutrition and sleep data from participants or available datasets. Handle missing or inconsistent entries.
#### Data Categorization: 
- Classify individuals into healthy and unhealthy eating groups based on nutrient balance, processed food intake, and caloric ratios.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Generate visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices) to explore trends between eating habits and sleep variables.
#### Statistical Analysis: 
- Apply correlation tests, linear regression, or ANOVA to evaluate the significance of nutritional factors on sleep quality.
#### Interpretation:
- Identify which eating behaviors are most predictive of good or poor sleep outcomes and summarize findings in a clear, evidence-based format.
### Expected Outcomes

It is expected that individuals with healthier eating patterns, characterized by balanced macronutrient intake, lower sugar and processed food consumption, and consistent meal timing will show higher sleep efficiency, shorter sleep latency, and longer total sleep duration.
The analysis may also reveal that excessive caffeine, high-calorie intake before bedtime, or dehydration are linked to poorer sleep quality.
Ultimately, the results are expected to emphasize the importance of dietary balance for improved sleep and overall well-being.
Limitations and Future Work
The dataset may rely on self-reported information, which can introduce bias or inaccuracies.
Other factors such as stress, mental health, and genetic predisposition may also influence sleep but are not directly included in this phase.
Future work could integrate longitudinal data to observe changes in sleep patterns over time and use machine learning models to predict sleep quality based on daily diet logs.
Expanding the dataset to include different age groups or cultural dietary habits could also provide more generalizable insights.
